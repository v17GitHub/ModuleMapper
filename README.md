# F.A.Q.

(Q) Is this a virus or in any way malicious?


(A) No! ModuleMapper is 100% clean and contains no code which will negatively affect performance towards your operating system.


(Q) What language was this made in?


(A) ModuleMapper was created in C# with the .NET Framework of 4.7.2


(Q) Why is ModuleMapper interacting with the internet?


(A) The only time that MM has any connections towards the internet at all is when you check for updates in the credits Form. The reason it connects with the internet is to compare your version with the latest version to determine if you are using an outdated build or not.


(Q) How does the injection process work?


(A) The procedure is relatively simple to understand. You select a module and then post-injection the bytes of the file will be read and then streamed into the process you wish to load the buffer (bytes) into.  


(Q) Why is the program window title and program name changed into scrambled characters?


(A) This occurs purposely and is not to make the program look weird or funny. This is done to take another simple step into making builds more secure and unique to make each individual person have as non-identical executable.

# How To Use

1) Type in your process name (without .exe) which you are going to map the image into.
2) Press the 'Select file' button and select the dll file which you chose to stream into memory.
3) Finally, if the dll exists in the selected path and the process you selected is running, simply press 'Map Image Into Memory' and you will be prompted with a successful dialog if you have done everything correctly.

# Installation Guide

1) Download the latest build of the executable at: https://github.com/v17GitHub/ModuleMapper/blob/main/Build/LatestBuild.exe
2) Place the executable file anywhere on your computer and run it. NOTE: The file may get detected as malware and or a virus, in this instance just disable your anti-virus or have an exception towards the executable.
